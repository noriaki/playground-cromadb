## Version Control and Collaboration

- **Git Version Control**:
  - Appropriate granularity and timing for version control using Git
  - Following GitHub Flow branch strategy: creating and switching branches per task
  - Commit messages and Pull Requests will be written in concise, clear English
  - All merges to the main branch must go through Pull Requests
    - In principle, users will review Pull Requests on GitHub and perform merges
    - Claude may merge Pull Requests only when explicitly instructed by the user
  - Actively utilize MCP server Tool functions for Git and GitHub operations
