# Progress

## Current Status

- Complete Markdown processing pipeline with semantic chunking is now implemented
- ChromaDB integration works correctly with proper metadata handling
- Memory optimization across the codebase provides stable memory usage
- Semantic processing with adaptive chunking improves search quality
- Memory profiling tools track resource usage effectively
- All changes have been merged to main branch after review
- System successfully processes 9 Markdown files into 41 semantic chunks
- **[NEW] Separated Markdown processing and Vector search functionality**
  - `processor.ts` - Handles Markdown file processing and registration
  - `index.ts` - Handles search functionality only
  - Added scripts to run each function independently
- **[NEW] Performance optimization for Markdown registration process**
  - Optimized Docker configuration (4 CPUs, 4GB memory)
  - Enhanced parallel processing at file and chunk levels
  - Optimized batch sizes for API calls and database operations
  - Improved file reading with larger chunk sizes and better stream handling
  - System now processes 165 Markdown files into 2,218 chunks in 1m42s

## Next Steps

- Implement Web UI for better user experience
- Add metrics for embedding quality and search results
- Compare alternative embedding models
- Implement incremental processing for unchanged files
- Explore distributed processing for larger document collections
- Add automated testing suite
- **[NEW] Optimize data flow between separated components**
- **[NEW] Further optimize embedding generation with caching**
- **[NEW] Implement real-time monitoring dashboard for processing metrics**
- **[NEW] Explore alternative embedding models for quality/speed tradeoffs**
