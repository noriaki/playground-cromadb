## Current Status and Progress

- The project is structured with modular TypeScript files handling configuration, database client, collections, embedding, markdown processing, and search.
- The persistent ChromaDB database is created and updated with markdown file embeddings.
- CLI-based similarity search is implemented and tested.
- No Web UI or automated tests are included as per the plan.
- MCP server integration is minimal, focusing on GitHub Flow operations.

## Known Issues and Remaining Tasks

- Extension ideas such as Web UI, metrics, embedding model comparison, multimodal support, and data sync remain to be implemented.
- Troubleshooting guidelines are documented but may require updates as the project evolves.
