## Current Status and Progress

- The project is structured with modular TypeScript files handling configuration, database client, collections, embedding, markdown processing, and search.
- ChromaDB server is containerized using Docker with docker-compose for easy deployment and management.
- Persistent storage is configured via Docker volume mounted to the local chroma_db/ directory.
- The TypeScript application connects to the ChromaDB server via HTTP API.
- CLI-based similarity search is implemented and tested.
- No Web UI or automated tests are included as per the plan.
- MCP server integration is minimal, focusing on GitHub Flow operations.

## Known Issues and Remaining Tasks

- Docker環境の最適化（リソース制限、セキュリティ設定など）が今後の課題として残っています。
- Extension ideas such as Web UI, metrics, embedding model comparison, multimodal support, and data sync remain to be implemented.
- Troubleshooting guidelines are documented but may require updates as the project evolves.
- Docker環境でのトラブルシューティング手順の拡充が必要です。
