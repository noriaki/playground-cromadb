# Memory Optimization: ChromaDB Markdown Indexing

## 1. Problem Overview

When executing `pnpm run dev`, a JavaScript heap memory error occurred during the processing of Markdown files, specifically while processing `messaging-api.md`:

```text
FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

This document consolidates the analysis, solutions, and architectural recommendations for addressing memory issues in the ChromaDB Markdown indexing process.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Identified Causes

Through systematic debugging and testing, the following key factors were identified as contributing to the memory error:

1. **Inefficient Markdown Processing**
   - HTML rendering using `markdown-it` consumed excessive memory
   - The conversion process in `markdownToText` function created large temporary objects

2. **Monolithic Data Processing**
   - Loading entire files into memory at once
   - Processing all chunks simultaneously rather than incrementally
   - No streaming or progressive loading implementation

3. **Large Chunk Sizes**
   - Default chunk size (1000 characters) created too many large objects
   - Overlap between chunks (200 characters) increased memory redundancy

4. **Batch Embedding Generation**
   - Sending multiple chunks to OpenAI API in a single request
   - Holding all embeddings in memory before database insertion

5. **Insufficient Memory Management**
   - No explicit memory release or garbage collection hints
   - References to large objects persisting longer than necessary

### 2.2 Verification Method

The root causes were verified by:

1. Implementing targeted fixes for each suspected issue
2. Testing with dummy data to isolate the Markdown processing component
3. Monitoring memory usage patterns during execution
4. Observing which changes had the most significant impact

## 3. Implemented Solutions

### 3.1 Node.js Memory Limit Adjustment

**Implementation:**

```json
"dev": "NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 pnpm exec ts-node src/index.ts"
```

**Impact:**

- Provided more headroom for processing
- Alone was insufficient to solve the problem
- Serves as a safety measure alongside other optimizations

### 3.2 Markdown Processing Optimization

**Implementation:**

- Replaced `markdown-it` HTML rendering with lightweight regex-based text extraction
- Reduced chunk size from 1000 to 250 characters
- Reduced overlap from 200 to 50 characters
- Added safety checks to prevent array allocation errors

```typescript
export function markdownToText(markdown: string): string {
  try {
    // Use regex-based approach instead of HTML rendering to reduce memory usage
    return markdown
      .replace(/^#+\s+(.*)$/gm, "$1") // Convert headings to plain text
      .replace(/\[([^\]]+)\]\([^)]+\)/g, "$1") // Convert links to text only
      .replace(/\*\*([^*]+)\*\*/g, "$1") // Remove bold markers
      // Additional regex replacements...
      .trim();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error converting markdown to text:", error);
    return markdown; // Return original markdown if conversion fails
  }
}
```

**Impact:**

- Significantly reduced memory consumption during parsing
- Eliminated large temporary HTML objects
- Improved processing speed

### 3.3 Streaming File Processing

**Implementation:**

- Added file streaming capabilities to process content incrementally
- Implemented line-by-line and chunk-by-chunk processing functions
- Created dedicated stream handling utilities

```typescript
export async function processMarkdownFileByChunk(
  filePath: string,
  chunkSize: number,
  chunkProcessor: (chunk: string) => Promise<void>
): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    try {
      const fileStream = createMarkdownFileStream(filePath);
      let buffer = '';

      fileStream.on('data', async (chunk: string) => {
        fileStream.pause(); // Pause the stream while processing
        
        buffer += chunk;
        
        // Process complete chunks
        while (buffer.length >= chunkSize) {
          const processChunk = buffer.slice(0, chunkSize);
          buffer = buffer.slice(chunkSize);
          
          try {
            await chunkProcessor(processChunk);
          } catch (error) {
            fileStream.destroy();
            reject(error);
            return;
          }
        }
        
        fileStream.resume(); // Resume the stream after processing
      });

      // Handle end and error events...
    } catch (error) {
      reject(error);
    }
  });
}
```

**Impact:**

- Avoided loading entire files into memory at once
- Enabled processing of arbitrarily large files
- Created a foundation for pipeline-based processing

### 3.4 Embedding Generation Optimization

**Implementation:**

- Reduced batch size to 1 (processing one chunk at a time)
- Added explicit memory management hints
- Implemented small delays between batches to allow for garbage collection

```typescript
export async function generateEmbeddings(texts: string[]): Promise<number[][]> {
  try {
    // Process in small batches to reduce memory usage
    const embeddings: number[][] = [];
    
    // Process texts in batches
    for (let i = 0; i < texts.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
      const batchTexts = texts.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
      console.log(`Processing embedding batch ${i / BATCH_SIZE + 1} of ${Math.ceil(texts.length / BATCH_SIZE)}`);
      
      const response = await openai.embeddings.create({
        model: EMBEDDING_MODEL,
        input: batchTexts,
      });
      
      // Extract embeddings from response
      const batchEmbeddings = response.data.map(item => item.embedding);
      embeddings.push(...batchEmbeddings);
      
      // Explicitly help garbage collection
      response.data.length = 0;
      
      // Add a small delay between batches to allow for GC
      if (i + BATCH_SIZE < texts.length) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
      }
    }
    
    return embeddings;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating embeddings:", error);
    throw new Error(`Failed to generate embeddings: ${error}`);
  }
}
```

**Impact:**

- Prevented memory buildup during API calls
- Reduced peak memory usage
- Improved stability during long-running operations

### 3.5 Processing Flow Restructuring

**Implementation:**

- Modified the main processing flow to use streaming and incremental processing
- Implemented proper error handling and safety checks
- Added logging for better visibility into the process

```typescript
// Process each file using streaming approach
for (const filePath of markdownPaths) {
  console.log(`Processing ${filePath} using streaming approach...`);
  
  // Process file in chunks to avoid loading entire file into memory
  let fileContent = '';
  let chunkCounter = 0;
  
  // Define chunk processing function
  const processFileChunk = async (chunk: string) => {
    // Accumulate content
    fileContent += chunk;
    
    // When we have enough content, process it
    if (fileContent.length >= 5000) { // Process in 5KB chunks
      // Convert markdown to text
      const text = markdownToText(fileContent);
      
      // Create smaller chunks for embedding
      const textChunks = chunkText(text);
      console.log(`Created ${textChunks.length} text chunks from file chunk`);
      
      // Process each text chunk individually to minimize memory usage
      for (const textChunk of textChunks) {
        try {
          // Generate embedding for single chunk
          console.log(`Processing text chunk ${++chunkCounter} from ${filePath}`);
          const embedding = await generateEmbedding(textChunk);
          
          // Create ID and metadata
          const id = `${filePath.replace(/[\/\\]/g, "_")}_chunk_${chunkCounter}`;
          const metadata = { source: filePath };
          
          // Upsert single chunk into ChromaDB
          await upsertDocuments(collection, [id], [textChunk], [embedding], [metadata]);
          console.log(`Upserted chunk ${chunkCounter} from ${filePath}`);
          
          // Add a small delay to allow for GC
          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(`Error processing text chunk ${chunkCounter}:`, error);
          throw error;
        }
      }
      
      // Reset accumulated content but keep a small overlap
      const overlapSize = 200;
      fileContent = fileContent.slice(-overlapSize);
      
      // Explicitly help garbage collection
      textChunks.length = 0;
      // Try to force garbage collection if available
      if (typeof global.gc === 'function') {
        try {
          global.gc();
        } catch (e) {
          // Ignore if gc is not available
        }
      }
    }
  };
  
  // Process the file using streaming
  await processMarkdownFileByChunk(filePath, 1024, processFileChunk);
  
  // Process any remaining content...
}
```

**Impact:**

- Created a more efficient overall memory usage pattern
- Enabled processing of larger datasets
- Improved error handling and recovery
