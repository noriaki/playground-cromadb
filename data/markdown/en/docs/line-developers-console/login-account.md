# [#](#page-title) Log in to LINE Developers

You can log in to [LINE Developers Console](../../../console.md) using one of the following accounts.

For more information, see the difference between [Log in with LINE account and Log in with business account (opens new window)](https://help2.line.me/business_id/web/pc?lang=en&contentId=20011265)in Help Center.

Which account should I use to log in?

If you're already using LINE, you can use your existing LINE account to log in. If you don't want to use your personal LINE account, you can use your work email address to create a business account. However, if you log in with a business account, there may be some limitations to the [available features](#available-features).

## [#](#log-in-to-line-developers-console) Log in to LINE Developers Console

Two-factor authentication is enabled when logging in with LINE account

Two-factor authentication is enabled when you log in using your LINE account. When you log in from a browser on your computer using an email address, you must enter the email address and password of your LINE account, and then enter the authentication code displayed on your smartphone's LINE App.

![Two-factor authentication flow](/assets/img/login-flow-with-2fa-en.f6af008f.png)

Once two-factor authentication is executed, the browser used to log in won't require two-factor authentication again for one year. Also, if you've already logged in to [LINE Official Account Manager (opens new window)](https://manager.line.biz/) using two-factor authentication, you won't be required to log in to the LINE Developers Console with the same account.

## [#](#account-relationships) Account relationships

You need a developer account to use the LINE Developers Console. In addition, a developer account is always linked to a business account on a one-to-one basis.

A developer account and a LINE account are linked through a business account. When you link your LINE account to your business account that is linked to your developer account, you can link your LINE account to your developer account.

The developer account you created when you started using the LINE Developers Console is also linked to a business account, regardless of the type of the account used when you logged in the first time. The relationship between the type of an account used for the first login and the connection to the developer account is as follows:

| Type of account            | Linked state                                        | LINE account to be linked                           | Business account to be linked                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LINE account               | Business account isn't linked                       | LINE account used for login                         | A new business account will be created and linked to the developer account (\*) |
| Business account is linked | LINE account used for login                         | Business account that is linked to the LINE account |                                                                                 |
| Business account           | LINE account isn't linked                           | None                                                | Business account used for login                                                 |
| LINE account linked        | LINE account already linked to the business account | Business account used for log in                    |                                                                                 |

\* The new business account will be linked to the LINE account used for the first login. The email address and password will be left unset and can be set at any time later.

> [!warning]
> Note on linking your developer account to your business account
>
> - If you delete the business account linked with your developer account, you will no longer be able to log in to your developer account
> - A business account linked with a developer account can't be changed later

About the email address for each account

The name and email address registered for your developer account, business account, and LINE account are managed separately. Therefore, the email addresses registered to each account may be different.

## [#](#available-features) Available features

Depending on the account you use to log in to LINE Developers Console, you can create different channel types.

Depending on the roles assigned to the developer account you're using, there are restrictions on the features you can use. For more information, see [Managing roles](../../../en/docs/line-developers-console/managing-roles.md).

The following channel types can be created for each account:

|                                               | LINE Login | Blockchain Service | LINE MINI App |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| LINE account                                  | ✅         | ✅                 | ✅ \*         |
| Business account linked to a LINE account     | ✅         | ✅                 | ✅ \*         |
| Business account not linked to a LINE account | ✅         | ❌                 | ✅ \*         |

\* When creating a LINE MINI App channel, there may be restrictions depending on the conditions of the region to provide the service, etc. For more information, see [Precautions for LINE MINI App channel creation](../../../en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/develop-overview.md#precautions-for-channel-creation) in the LINE MINI App documentation.

Messaging API channels can be created by creating LINE Official Accounts. For more information, see [Get started with the Messaging API](../../../en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started.md) in the Messaging API documentation.
