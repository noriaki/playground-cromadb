# [#](#page-title) LINE API SDKs

Downloading source code may not be necessary

You may not need to download the source code listed on this page to use the LINE SDK in your app. Read the SDK's documentation for integration instructions.

Nevertheless, you can download the SDK source code from this page if necessary.

## [#](#messaging-api-sdks) LINE Messaging API SDKs

### [#](#line-openapi) LINE OpenAPI

LINE OpenAPI is a set of API interfaces provided by the LINE Platform, such as the Messaging API and LIFF server API, defined according to the OpenAPI specification. By using code generators such as [OpenAPI Generator (opens new window)](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) and [Swagger Codegen (opens new window)](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen), you can easily use the features provided by the LINE Platform even in programming languages for which no SDK is provided.

The community SDKs and libraries are developed by third party developers and are available under general open source licenses. LY Corporation conducts limited reviews on the community SDKs, but doesn't provide official support or guarantee for the SDKs. See the licenses and disclaimers for each community SDK.
