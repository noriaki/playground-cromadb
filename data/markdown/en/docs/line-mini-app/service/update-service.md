# [#](#page-title) Re-review after updating your verified MINI App

If you update the following information in the [LINE Developers Console](../../../../console.md) after your LINE MINI App becomes a verified MINI App, a re-review is required. All other information can be freely updated without a review.

Re-review isn't required for changes that don't involve settings in the LINE Developers Console. However, when updating the service content or features, make sure that you have complied with the [LINE MINI App Policy (opens new window)](https://terms2.line.me/LINE_MINI_App?lang=en).

If you would like to check whether or not your updates can be published as a LINE MINI App, see [How can I check whether or not my updates can be published when updating the service content, features, etc. of a released LINE MINI App? (opens new window)](https://help.linebiz.com/lineadshelp/s/article/L000002146?language=ja) (only available in Japanese) in LINE for Business.

If we find any expressions that we deem inappropriate in the released LINE MINI App (including all content and creatives delivered), you're required to take immediate action to correct them. Failure to do so may result in penalties. For more information, see Penalties in the [LINE MINI App Policy (opens new window)](https://terms2.line.me/LINE_MINI_App?lang=en).

Temporary suspension of published LINE MINI Apps

Temporarily replace the published **Endpoint URL** with a different URL for maintenance or other legitimate reasons, you don't need to request a re-review your LINE MINI App. The page will be switched over immediately after the change of the **Endpoint URL**.

For more information, see [Submitting LINE MINI App](../../../../en/docs/line-mini-app/submit/submission-guide.md).
