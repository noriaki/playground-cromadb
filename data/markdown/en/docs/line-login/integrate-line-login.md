# [#](#page-title) Integrating LINE Login with your web app

[LINE Login v2.1](../../../en/docs/line-login/overview.md) supports the [OpenID Connect (opens new window)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) protocol and allows you to retrieve user data with ID tokens. In this guide, we explain how to build it into your web app.

You can follow along using a sample app if you donâ€™t have an existing app that you can update to support LINE Login. To learn more, see [Getting started with LINE Login](../../../en/docs/line-login/getting-started.md).

> [!warning]
> Note
>
> - If you are integrating LINE Login v2.0 with your web app, see Integrating LINE Login (v2.0) with your web app.
> - We strongly recommend building your LINE Login integration with a LINE SDK if it's available for your development environment. We don't recommend using the procedure described in this page for native apps. For more information on using a LINE SDK, see [Integrating with native apps](../../../en/docs/line-login/overview.md#native-app).

## [#](#login-flow) Login flow

The LINE Login process for web apps (web login) is based on the [OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow (opens new window)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and the [OpenID Connect (opens new window)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) protocol. An overview of the web login flow is shown below.

Web apps must implement any part of the login flow that is relevant to them in the flowchart.

## [#](#create-a-channel) Create a channel

[Create a LINE Login channel](../../../en/docs/line-login/getting-started.md#step-1-create-channel) and configure it for use with a web app.

- [Setting a callback URL](#setting-callback-url)
- [Requesting permission to access the user's email address](#applying-for-email-permission)

### [#](#setting-callback-url) Setting a callback URL

After the user has been authenticated and authorized your web app, the authorization code and `state` are sent to the callback URL.

Set a callback URL from the **LINE Login** tab of your channel settings in the [LINE Developers Console](../../../console.md). You can specify multiple callback URLs per channel by adding a new line.

### [#](#applying-for-email-permission) Requesting permission to access the user's email address

LINE Login v2.1 allows you to obtain the email address of any user who has logged in to your app using LINE Login.

To obtain a user's email address with a web app, you must first apply for permission to do so in the [LINE Developers Console](../../../console.md).

1. On the **Basic settings** tab, under **OpenID Connect**, click **Apply**.

2. Agree to the terms and upload a screenshot of the screen that explains that you're collecting the user's email address and what you're using it for.

    Once your application form has been accepted, "Applied" is displayed under **Email address permission**.

## [#](#making-an-authorization-request) Authenticating users and making authorization requests

Initiate the process of authenticating the user with the LINE Platform and authorizing your app. When the user clicks a LINE Login button, redirect them to an authorization URL with the required query parameters, as shown in the example below.

```
https://access.line.me/oauth2/v2.1/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=1234567890&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fauth%3Fkey%3Dvalue&state=12345abcde&scope=profile%20openid&nonce=09876xyz
```

You can pass these query parameters to the authorization URL.

Tip

- Follow the [LINE Login button design guidelines](../../../en/docs/line-login/login-button.md) when adding a LINE Login button to your web app.
- You can also link directly to an authorization URL without showing a LINE Login button.
- The user's authentication credentials aren't sent to your web app.

> [!warning]
> Authorization requests within LIFF browser
>
> The behavior of LINE Login authorization requests within the LIFF browser is not guaranteed. Also, when opening the LIFF App from an external browser, use [liff.login()](../../../en/reference/liff.md#login) instead of authorization requests through LINE Login.

### [#](#scopes) Scopes

You can specify the following scopes with the `scope` parameter. To specify multiple scopes, separate them using a URL-encoded whitespace character (%20).

| Scope                    | Profileinformation | ID token(including user ID) | Display namein ID token | Profile image URLin ID token | Email addressin ID token |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| profile                  | âœ“                  | -                           | -                       | -                            | -                        |
| profile%20openid         | âœ“                  | âœ“                           | âœ“                       | âœ“                            | -                        |
| profile%20openid%20email | âœ“                  | âœ“                           | âœ“                       | âœ“                            | âœ“ (see note)             |
| openid                   | -                  | âœ“                           | -                       | -                            | -                        |
| openid%20email           | -                  | âœ“                           | -                       | -                            | âœ“ (see note)             |

**Note:** Before you can specify the `email` scope and ask the user for permission to obtain their email address, you must first [submit an application requesting access to users' email addresses](#applying-for-email-permission).

Requesting scopes not listed above

- If you wish to obtain the information (name, gender, birthday, phone number, address) that users have registered with LINE Profile+, you need to undergo the application process. For more information, see LINE Profile+ in the options for corporate customers documentation.
- You need an access token with the `profile` scope to [determine whether a user has added a LINE Official Account as a friend](../../../en/docs/line-login/link-a-bot.md#use-line-login-api).

### [#](#authentication-process) User authentication

User authentication is handled directly by the LINE Platform

Web apps that support LINE Login don't have to implement the authentication process themselves.

Users can log in through one of the following authentication methods once they have been redirected to an authorization URL.

| Authentication method      | Description                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Auto login                 | Log in without user operation. The LINE Login screen or the confirmation screen is not displayed                         |
| Log in with email address  | Log in by entering an email address and password on the LINE Login screen                                                |
| Log in with QR code        | Log in by scanning a QR code displayed on the LINE Login screen using the QR code reader on the LINE app for smartphones |
| Single Sign On (SSO) login | Log in by clicking the login button on the confirmation screen showing "Continue as"                                     |

In an environment where auto login is available, auto login will take precedence. When auto login is not available, [Single Sign On (SSO) login](#line-sso-login) will be displayed if SSO is available, and [log in with email address](#mail-or-qrcode-login) will be displayed if it is not available.

> [!warning]
> Auto login takes precedence over SSO login
>
> Auto login takes precedence in an environment where both auto login and SSO login are enabled. For more information, see the news "[Auto login will take precedence over SSO login for LINE Login](../../../en/news/2021/07/12/auto-login-takes-precedence-over-sso.md)" published on July 12, 2021.
>
> If you want users to log in via SSO login instead of auto login, you can disable auto login by adding a specific query parameter (`disable_auto_login`) to the authorization URL when [Authenticating users and making authorization requests](#making-an-authorization-request).

> [!warning]
> Login notification
>
> After you log in, a login notification is sent from the LINE Official Account. For more information about login notifications, see [I got a notification about a detected login (opens new window)](https://help.line.me/line/android/pc?lang=en&contentId=20014794) in Help Center.

Authentication method chosen by the user

You can examine the ID token to determine which authentication method was selected by the user. To learn more about ID tokens, see the "Response" section of [Getting an access token](#get-access-token).

#### [#](#line-auto-login) Auto login

Login is enabled without user operation. The LINE Login screen or the confirmation screen isn't displayed.

Users are automatically logged in when they visit an authorization URL from one of the following browsers while logged in to LINE's smartphone app.

- LINE's in-app browser
- External browser used for LINE Login

As shown below, the LINE app is automatically launched upon login, and the user is logged in without any operation:

![auto-ligin-animation](/assets/img/auto-ligin-animation.c307180a.gif)

> [!warning]
> Auto login doesn't work on LINE for PC
>
> For more information on environments that can use auto login, see [How does auto login work?](../../../en/faq.md#how-does-auto-login-work) in the FAQ.

> [!warning]
> Auto login may fail
>
> If a user accesses a web app with private browsing enabled, auto login may fail.
>
> In other cases, depending on the specifications of the user's OS, auto login may fail. Since the specifications of the OS aren't fully disclosed, it may be difficult for the LINE Platform to avoid the conditions under which auto login fails.
>
> For more information, see [How to handle auto login failure](../../../en/docs/line-login/how-to-handle-auto-login-failure.md).

About automatic login from the Yahoo! JAPAN app

Auto login is enabled when accessing a web app that incorporates LINE Login with PKCE implementation from the Yahoo! Japan app. For more information on PKCE support for LINE Login, see [PKCE support for LINE Login](../../../en/docs/line-login/integrate-pkce.md) in the LINE Login documentation.

#### [#](#mail-or-qrcode-login) Log in with email address or QR code

A user can login with one of these authentication methods.

- Log in with email address
- Log in with QR code

![Login dialog](/assets/img/login-with-new-session.7620fe6f.png)

These login methods can be used when accessing the authorization URL in an external browser for the first time without logging in to the LINE app for smartphones.

#### [#](#line-sso-login) Single Sign On (SSO) login

The user can log in only by clicking the login button.

![Confirmation Screen](/assets/img/sso.2c02ee3d.png)

SSO is available when the user visits an authorization URL in an external browser that they used to log in to LINE before.

> [!warning]
> SSO is a function that uses cookies
>
> Once you run LINE Login from your web application, the cookie is saved under the domain name `access.line.me`. As long as the cookie is valid, the SSO screen is displayed for login in the same browser.

> [!warning]
> Auto login takes precedence over SSO login
>
> Auto login takes precedence in an environment where both auto login and SSO login are enabled. For more information, see the news "[Auto login will take precedence over SSO login for LINE Login](../../../en/news/2021/07/12/auto-login-takes-precedence-over-sso.md)" published on July 12, 2021.

### [#](#authorization-process) User authorization

User authorization is handled directly by the LINE Platform

Web apps that support LINE Login don't have to implement the authorization process themselves.

Developers specify the information they'd like to access in the `scope` parameter, and users are asked to authorize those requests.

Note that users may access your web app without granting it some or all of the requested permissions. When building your web app, you should account for the possibility that the user may not grant the permissions you specified in the authorization URL.

**Example Consent Screen:**

![Consent screen](/assets/img/consent-screen-en.2656a475.png)

> [!warning]
> The consent screen may not always be shown
>
> - If the permissions specified in the `scope` parameter are `profile` and/or `openid` and the user has already granted all the permissions, the consent screen is not displayed.
> - If the permissions include `email`, a consent screen is not displayed for a certain period unless the user's email address changes.

## [#](#receiving-the-authorization-code-or-error-response-with-a-web-app) Receiving the authorization response or error response with a web app

The user is redirected to the callback URL once they have completed the authentication and authorization process.

If the user has granted access to your app, an authorization response containing an authorization code is returned. If the user hasn't granted access to your app, an error response is returned.

### [#](#receiving-the-authorization-code) Receiving the authorization code

Once the user has been authenticated and has completed the authorization step, they are redirected to the callback URL. How the authorization response parameters, including the authorization code, are received depends on the value of the `response_mode` parameter of the authorization request. For more information, see [Authenticating users and making authorization requests](#making-an-authorization-request).

The authorization response parameters are as follows:

| Parameter                 | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### [#](#receiving-an-error-response) Receiving an error response

If the user declines to grant permissions to your app, or if the request fails (except when the `client_id` or `redirect_uri` query parameters have invalid values), they are redirected to the callback URL with the following query parameters:

| Parameter         | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                          |

## [#](#get-access-token) Getting an access token with a web app

You can obtain an access token if the `state` parameter that you receive along with the authorization code from the LINE Platform matches the `state` parameter that you specified when [authenticating the user and making an authorization request](#making-an-authorization-request).

For more information on getting an access token, see [issue access token](../../../en/reference/line-login.md#issue-access-token) in the LINE Login v2.1 API reference.

Example request:

```
curl -v -X POST https://api.line.me/oauth2/v2.1/token \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
-d 'code=1234567890abcde' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=https://example.com/auth?key=value' \
-d 'client_id=1234567890' \
-d 'client_secret=1234567890abcdefghij1234567890ab'
```

### [#](#response) Response

The LINE Platform validates the request and returns an access token and other data as shown in the table below.
