## [#](#use-qr-code) Use QR code

Share the QR code for your LINE Official Account on your website or in a printed format. Users only need to scan your QR code to add your LINE Official Account as a friend. You can get the QR code from the [LINE Developers Console](../../../console.md) or [LINE Official Account Manager (opens new window)](https://manager.line.biz/).

From the LINE Developers Console, click the **Messaging API** tab of your channel settings.

## [#](#share-the-line-id-of-your-line-official-account) Share the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account

Let users know the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account so that the users can search for your LINE Official Account and add your LINE Official Account as a friend on LINE. Find the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account from the header in the [LINE Official Account Manager (opens new window)](https://manager.line.biz/). The text with the at-sign (@) prefix is the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account.

Also, you can purchase a premium ID to create a customized LINE ID that is easier for users to remember. For more information on the premium ID, see [Subscription plan (opens new window)](https://www.lycbiz.com/jp/service/line-official-account/plan/) (only available in Japanese) in LINE for Business.
