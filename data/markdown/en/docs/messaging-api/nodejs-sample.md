# [#](#page-title) Tutorial - Make a reply bot

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to send a message with the Messaging API and Node.js through a reply bot.

The Messaging API enables two-way communication between your service and LINE users. With the Messaging API, you can boost interactions with users by taking advantage of a wide range of functions that it offers. These functions include sending different types of messages, getting user profile, getting content sent by users, and [many more](../../../en/docs/messaging-api/overview.md#what-you-can-do).

The outcome of this tutorial is an app which automatically responds to a user's message.

## [#](#before-starting) Before you start

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js. Before you continue with this tutorial, we recommend that you read through [Messaging API overview](../../../en/docs/messaging-api/overview.md).

This tutorial doesn't use an SDK

To help you learn the Messaging API, this tutorial shows you how to use the Messaging API with Node.js, but without the SDK provided by LY Corporation. To speed things up and write less lines of code for your project with Node.js, try the [LINE Messaging API SDK for nodejs (opens new window)](https://line.github.io/line-bot-sdk-nodejs/).

### [#](#what-you-will-need) Preparation

To create a reply bot for this tutorial, first register to required systems and install required tools as specified below.

Register these accounts:

- A [LINE Developers Console](../../../console.md) account: Log in to the LINE Developers Console with your LINE account or business account and [create a developer account](../../../en/docs/line-developers-console/login-account.md#register-as-developer) if you don't already have one.
- A [Heroku (opens new window)](https://www.heroku.com/) account

  > [!warning]
  > Heroku's free plan has been discontinued
  >
  > Heroku's free plan is discontinued as of November 27, 2022. To try this tutorial for free, use a different platform. For more information, see [Herokuâ€™s Next Chapter (opens new window)](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter).

Install these tools:

- [Node.js (opens new window)](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Heroku CLI (opens new window)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- [Git (opens new window)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## [#](#set-up-heroku) 1. Set up Heroku

Log in to the Heroku CLI. Run this command in your terminal or command line tool.

```
heroku login
```

Create a directory for the tutorial and move to the directory. Initialize Git and create an app with Heroku. Replace `{Name of your app}` with a unique name such as `msg-api-tutorial-{YYYYMMDD}`.

```
mkdir sample-app
cd sample-app
git init
heroku create {Name of your app}
```

If your app is created successfully, a Heroku URL is generated in the form of `https://{Name of your app}.herokuapp.com/`. You need this URL later in the tutorial, so keep the URL. Open the Heroku URL in your browser. The welcome page is displayed.

![Welcome page](/assets/img/welcome-page.429f0796.png)

## [#](#create-package-json) 2. Set up the project

We need to make npm identify our project with a `package.json` file. The file is to have this project's metadata and define dependencies. Create this file with the `npm init` command which initializes your npm package. Specify the `-y` option to skip all the questions asked during the setup, as no special configuration is required for this tutorial.

```
npm init -y
```

As a result, a `package.json` file is created similar to this:

```
{
  "name": "sample-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Next, specify the start script. This informs a server platform like Heroku to know which file to use when starting the server. In this tutorial, we'll set `index.js` as our server configuration file. Open `package.json` in a text editor and specify `"node index.js"` for the `"start"` property.

```
{
  "name": "sample-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Install the package [Express.js (opens new window)](https://expressjs.com/) with the command below. This is a lightweight Node.js web server framework we'll use in our project.

```
npm install express
```

When Express.js is installed, a package dependency is added in the `package.json`. At the same time, a directory named `node_modules` is created. This directory has packages installed locally and we don't want the content in this directory to be pushed to Heroku. To filter this directory out, make a `.gitignore` file:

```
touch .gitignore
```

Open the `.gitignore` file created in a text editor and add the name of the directory in the file to filter out as shown below.

```
node_modules/
```

This prevents the specified directory to be pushed.

## [#](#start-developing) 3. Implement the bot

Now that we completed the set up, let's begin to implement the reply bot:

1. [Set global configuration](#global-config)
2. [Set middleware](#middleware-config)
3. [Set routing](#routing-config)
4. [Send a reply](#send-reply)

### [#](#global-config) 3-1. Set global configuration

Let's create our main JavaScript file for server configuration, `index.js`.

```
touch index.js
```

Add a code in the `index.js` file created to import and instantiate `express`, the package we installed. Also import the `https` package to handle HTTP requests coming in to our bot. We don't need to import this package as it comes with Node.js by default.

Open the `index.js` in a text editor and add this block of code:

```
const https = require("https");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
```

Now, add environment variables to simplify configuration process and secure credentials. The `process.env.PORT` variable specifies which port the server is to listen to. The `process.env.LINE_ACCESS_TOKEN` has the [channel access token](../../../en/glossary.md#channel-access-token) required to call the Messaging API. In `index.js`, add these settings under imported packages:

```
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const TOKEN = process.env.LINE_ACCESS_TOKEN;
```

### [#](#middleware-config) 3-2. Set middleware

Express.js which we installed and imported is a middleware web framework. Middleware functions determine the flow of request-response cycle.

In this tutorial, we'll use Express.js functions `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`. These functions are pre-defined middleware functions to recognize incoming request objects in JSON, and string or arrays, respectively. To load the middleware functions, call `app.use()`. Add this block of code in the `index.js` file:

```
app.use(express.json());
app.use(
  express.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
  })
);
```

### [#](#routing-config) 3-3. Set routing

Now let's add a basic routing logic to our bot server. To prevent health check failure, let's return a status code `200` when an HTTP GET request is sent to the root (`/`) of our domain. Add this block of code in the `index.js` file:

```
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

Next, set a listener to our server with the `app.listen()` function. Set the port of our listener to the `PORT` environment variable we set earlier. Our listener will listen to `3000`, because that is the value we set, unless you specify a different port number. Add this code in `index.js`:

```
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

Now that our server can listen, we want to add the code to handle the requests the LINE Platform sends to the webhook URL. When a user interacts with your bot,the LINE Platform sends a request (webhook event) to the webhook URL that your bot server hosts. To process such requests, route the requests with the `app.post()`. Add this code in the `index.js` file, in between `app.get()` and `app.listen()` functions:

```
app.post("/webhook", function (req, res) {
  res.send("HTTP POST request sent to the webhook URL!");
});
```

This code tells the bot server to return the HTTP response `HTTP POST request sent to the webhook URL!` when a HTTP POST request is sent to the `/webhook` endpoint.

So far, your `index.js` should look something like this:

```
const https = require("https");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const TOKEN = process.env.LINE_ACCESS_TOKEN;

app.use(express.json());
app.use(
  express.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
  })
);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

app.post("/webhook", function (req, res) {
  res.send("HTTP POST request sent to the webhook URL!");
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### [#](#send-reply) 3-4. Send a reply

It's time to implement the core feature of our reply bot, sending a reply to a user's message. The first thing we need to do is to detect when users send a message to you. We detect when we receive at the webhook URL a [message event](../../../en/reference/messaging-api.md#message-event) with the `type` property set to `message`.

> [!danger]
> Verify the signature to publish the bot for production use
>
> Signature verification is necessary if you publish this sample bot to a production environment, for an unspecified number of users. Verify the signature in the request header `x-line-signature` to confirm that HTTP requests are sent from the LINE Platform.
>
> For more information on how to verify signatures, see [Verify signature](../../../en/docs/messaging-api/receiving-messages.md#verify-signature).

To send a reply to the user, we use the [send reply message](../../../en/reference/messaging-api.md#send-reply-message) endpoint. From the `app.post()` in the `index.js` file, call the send reply message endpoint (`https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`). Replace `app.post` with this code. Check the comments in the code below for detailed explanation:

```
app.post("/webhook", function (req, res) {
  res.send("HTTP POST request sent to the webhook URL!");
  // If the user sends a message to your bot, send a reply message
  if (req.body.events[0].type === "message") {
    // You must stringify reply token and message data to send to the API server
    const dataString = JSON.stringify({
      // Define reply token
      replyToken: req.body.events[0].replyToken,
      // Define reply messages
      messages: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: "Hello, user",
        },
        {
          type: "text",
          text: "May I help you?",
        },
      ],
    });

    // Request header. See Messaging API reference for specification
    const headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: "Bearer " + TOKEN,
    };

    // Options to pass into the request, as defined in the http.request method in the Node.js documentation
    const webhookOptions = {
      hostname: "api.line.me",
      path: "/v2/bot/message/reply",
      method: "POST",
      headers: headers,
      body: dataString,
    };

    // When an HTTP POST request of message type is sent to the /webhook endpoint,
    // we send an HTTP POST request to https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply
    // that is defined in the webhookOptions variable.

    // Define our request
    const request = https.request(webhookOptions, (res) => {
      res.on("data", (d) => {
        process.stdout.write(d);
      });
    });

    // Handle error
    // request.on() is a function that is called back if an error occurs
    // while sending a request to the API server.
    request.on("error", (err) => {
      console.error(err);
    });

    // Finally send the request and the data we defined
    request.write(dataString);
    request.end();
  }
});
```

## [#](#prepare-channel) 4. Prepare a Messaging API channel

To use the Messaging API, you need to have a Messaging API channel and register your webhook URL. [Create a channel](../../../en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started.md) if you don't have one yet.

From your Messaging API channel page on the LINE Developers Console, open the **Messaging API** tab and issue a [channel access token](../../../en/docs/basics/channel-access-token.md). We'll use this token when we [deploy our bot to Heroku](#deploy-on-heroku).

![Channel access token section in a Messaging API channel](/assets/img/channel-access-token-en.f96cca6c.png)

Next, register your webhook URL. In the **Messaging API** tab, based on the Heroku URL you obtained in the [Set up Heroku](#set-up-heroku) section, fill the URL where your server listens for webhooks. The URL is in the form of `https://{Name of your app}.herokuapp.com/webhook`. Note that **Webhook URL** is not `https://{Name of your app}.herokuapp.com/`.

Did you forget the Heroku URL?

If you forgot or lost your Heroku URL, you can get the URL from the [Heroku Dashboard (opens new window)](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

Lastly, enable the **Use webhook** settings.

!["Enable webhook" setting in Messaging API tab](/assets/img/enable-webhook-en.e7f4e4bb.png)

To test your bot, add your LINE Official Account associated with your bot as a friend on LINE by scanning the QR code on the **Messaging API** tab. For testing, disable the settings **Auto-reply messages** and **Greeting messages**.

Now your Messaging API channel is ready!

## [#](#deploy-on-heroku) 5. Deploy to Heroku

Earlier in the [global configuration](#global-config) section, we set an environment variable `LINE_ACCESS_TOKEN` to use as the channel access token. For the app deployed to Heroku to work properly, we need to set and register the environment variable `LINE_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

To register your channel access token with the environment variable, run this command in your terminal or command line tool. Set `LINE_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the channel access token you got from the [Prepare a Messaging API channel](#prepare-channel) section.

```
heroku config:set LINE_ACCESS_TOKEN={enter your channel access token here}
```

Now your app is ready to be deployed! Push your code to Heroku. Run these commands in your terminal or command line tool:

```
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push heroku main
```

### [#](#verify-webhook-url) Verify webhook URL

Before we test our bot, we want to check that webhook is working. Go to **Messaging API** tab for the channel you created in the [Prepare a Messaging API channel](#prepare-channel) section. Click **Verify** in **Webhook URL** to check that webhook is working. If there is no problem with the webhook URL, you'll see a message, "Success". You made a working bot.

### [#](#try-bot) Try the bot

Try to send a message to the bot on your LINE. If all is well, you'll receive a message from your bot like this:

![Conversation with a sample bot in the LINE chat room](/assets/img/sample-bot-test.b49c3438.png)

### [#](#troubleshoot-bot) Troubleshoot the sample bot

If your bot isn't working, check the Heroku log with this command:

```
heroku logs --tail
```

## [#](#further-development) Next steps

Continue your adventure with the Messaging API. The next quest for you is to add more features on the bot:

- Add [rich menus](../../../en/reference/messaging-api.md#rich-menu) to show tappable options to users.
- Respond to a user based on the [action object](../../../en/reference/messaging-api.md#action-objects) you receive when a user triggers an action.
- [Get a user's profile](../../../en/reference/messaging-api.md#get-profile) and send a customized message based on the profile information.

As introduced in the beginning of this tutorial, the [LINE Messaging API SDK for nodejs (opens new window)](https://line.github.io/line-bot-sdk-nodejs/) helps you to build a bot much quicker. Have a go at it!
