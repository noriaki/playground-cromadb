April 26, 2021

## [#](#seamless-sharing-experience-from-desktop-to-mobile) Seamless sharing experience from desktop to mobile

Your website visitors can now see all the groups they added in Favorites on the Friends tab and conveniently share content with their closest friends as well as groups on the desktop version of LINE.

Friends they've hidden on their mobile version of LINE will also remain hidden on the desktop version.

March 17, 2021

## [#](#removed-the-Like-and-share-option) Removed the "Like and share" option

We no longer provide the option of creating a "Like and share" button. If you already have a "Like and share" button on your website, it will automatically be changed to a Like button.

We have also updated the button designs according to the new LINE style. All your buttons will be updated automatically unless you're using a custom icon.

December 28, 2020

## [#](#added-an-option-to-customize-the-share-counter) Added an option to customize the share counter

You can now create the Share button using your custom icons, even when you select the option to show the share counter. We provide an API to check the number of shares via the custom icon and it must be called from the server side.

Refer to the section on "[Using custom icons.](../../../../en/docs/line-social-plugins/install-guide/using-line-share-buttons.md#using-custom-icons)"

December 17, 2020

## [#](#easily-share-content-from-desktop) Easily share content from desktop

Chats are now sorted to show the latest chats first on the desktop version of LINE, so your website visitors can quickly find the chat they're searching for.

We've also provided a way for them to immediately check shared content on Timeline.

April 1, 2020

## [#](#newly-added-share-counter) Newly added share counter

You can now see the number of times that the webpage was shared using the Share button. To do so, simply turn on the option for the share counter when you create the Share button.

Note that you can only use this option when using the official icons provided by LINE.

January 23, 2019

## [#](#our-service-has-a-new-name-line-social-plugins) Our service has a new name: LINE Social Plugins

We've been progressively changing our service name, but now it's official. You'll find that the old name "LINE it!" is no longer visible on any of our official websites. This also means that we have renamed the "LINE it!" button to Share.

May 15, 2018

## [#](#added-an-option-to-share-to-a-specific-audience) Added an option to share to a specific audience

Your website visitors can now choose whom they want to share content with on the desktop version of LINE. They can choose to make shared content visible to the public, friends, or set it to private so that it is only visible to themselves.

January 12, 2017

## [#](#new-add-friend-and-like-buttons) New Add friend and Like buttons

Use the Like button to allow others to react to your content, or the Add friend button to allow your visitors to add your LINE official account as a friend.

For more information, refer to the "[Installation guide.](../../../../en/docs/line-social-plugins.md)"

We also now support 2 new languages: Thai and Indonesian.

April 21, 2014

## [#](#support-of-traditional-chinese) Support of traditional Chinese

We now provide language support in traditional Chinese.

December 21, 2012
